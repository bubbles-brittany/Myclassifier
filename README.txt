Why corals?
Human activities have significant impact on coral reefs. Coral reefs are dying around the world. Damaging activities include coral mining, pollution, overfishing, blast fishing, the digging of canals and access into islands and bays. Other threats include disease, destructive fishing practices and warming oceans. 

Haiving a way to identify these corals will allow us to see where damage is being done specifically on certain coral and find a way to start preventative actions of enviomental damage.
